      <b>Introduction</b>
      <br />
      Sláinte-Link is a web3 based secure medical records system using blockchain 
      technology, inspired by ransomware attack the HSE suffered in 2021 which caused an 
      encryption of 80% of the HSE’s severs. Having a medical records system based on 
      a blockchain allows medical professionals to add patients medical data securely 
      and safely without it being at risk of theft or deletion. All of the medical records 
      held by the HSE to this day are still at risk of being stolen and deleted, which
      is not reliable and another ransomware attack could occur at any point. 
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Creation</b>
      <br />
       I started creating Sláinte-Link in May 2022 by creating a basic smart contract using Solidity.
      Solidity is an object-orientated programming language for making smart contracts.
      After I deployed the smart contract, I used a JavaScript API to connect it to a simple 
      website I made on Glitch. My first version of Sláinte-Link was only able to upload one 
      variable at a time to the blockchain. Uploading one or multiple variables at a time with
      multiple submit buttons is too complicated and crowded. The newest version of Sláinte
      Link uploads multiple variables to the blockchain in one submit button. How this works 
      is I created a form on my website, including a few different inputs, and one submit
      button. This submit button uploads every variable input to a database called JSON. 
      Then, the database is uploaded to the blockchain which is more efficient and easy 
      than having multiple submit buttons for different variables.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Wallet - MetaMask</b>
      <br />
      	For any smart contract to work, there needs to be some sort of transaction involved. 
      In this case, I am using tester ETH on my wallet MetaMask. MetaMask is a digital wallet 
      used for transactions on smart contracts. I use tester ETH from a UCLA faucet, as 
      buying ETH is very expensive. If the HSE were to use my method and idea for keeping 
      medical records, the would have an app with their own payment system, which they can set 
      as little or as expensive as they want. At the moment, each time I upload a form to the 
      blockchain it costs around €1.30, which use to be around 80c a couple of months ago when 
      I started my project. Depending on the time of day I upload a medical report, sometimes 
      it costs more than if I uploaded one earlier or later  in the day. It has increased because
      of inflation in the first place, but also when Ethereum underwent the migration from 
      PoW to PoS in October 2022. 
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Migration Process</b>
      <br />
      PoW (Proof of Work)  meant that more power and time was used to upload information onto 
      blocks, which wasn’t as efficient. PoS (Proof of Stake) means that everyone giving a bit 
      of energy to make running their smart contracts and uploading information  a lot faster 
      and using less energy. When the migration of PoS took place, they completely shut down 
      the Ropsten Test Blockchain, which was what Sláinte-Link was run on. Luckily they kept 
      the Goerli Test Blockchain so I had to migrate to running my project there, which wasn’t 
      a problem but it made the access to tester ETH a lot harder to get. Because of the costs 
      inflating and prevention of accessing tester ETH, I have to be careful every time I upload 
      information onto the blockchain. Sometimes it could cost 0.5 ETH or it could cost 
      0.000986 ETH. I could lose a lot of my ETH at any point if I make a wrong  purchase.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Website</b>
      <br />
      I made Sláinte-Link on Glitch, as Repl.it has been running slow for me and is not quick 
      to access. I used Solidity for the smart contract, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The Solidity 
      is connected to my website through a JavaScript API that I found on GitHub. Recently I made 
      a separate website including all of the HTML and CSS that my website would need and did 
      all of my design aspects on that website. I did this through separate websites as working 
      on my website with the API and all of the important code could potentially mess things up 
      and would be a lot harder to undo. After doing most of the design, I transferred all of 
      the JavaScript and important code to make it everything work onto my designed website to 
      create the first designed version of Sláinte-Link.

      <b>Doctor and Patient Uses</b>
      When you first go onto Sláinte-Link, it will bring you to the landing page of the 
      website, from there you can click to start or read about the website. If you click <b>account</b>
      or <b>click to start</b> it will bring you to a login page, where you will click the 
      appropriate button depending whether you are a patient or a doctor. Either way you will 
      be requested to enter a password, I have added this password as a safety feature because 
      if it wasn’t there, patient would have the ability to login as a doctor and add medical data, 
      which isn’t allowed. After entering the correct password it will bring you to the you 
      Sláinte-Link account page. From the doctors perspective you can enter a patients medical 
      data, submit, pay the transaction and then view all of the recent forms you have uploaded to 
      the blockchain. From a patient’s perspective you can login to the patients page and view 
      all of your recent forms that have already been uploaded by your doctor to the blockchain. 
      You can also see all of the recent blocks on the Goerli Etherscan. You can also read about 
      Sláinte-Link here on the <b>about</b> page.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Concludion</b>
      <br />
      In conclusion, Sláinte-Link makes uploading medical reports safely without being at risk of 
      theft or deletion. Which compared to the HSE’s medical records system is a lot more reliable,
      trustworthy and efficient. Sláinte-Link is done with Alpha testing, which is when the 
      programmer tests it. It is currently in Beta Testing which means I am getting other people 
      to test it. The people I have testing Sláinte-Link have access to MetaMask. I am still 
      tweaking and changing small details all the time, so anything here now could be slightly 
      changed and tweaked at any point.
